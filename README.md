# In development: Citizenship Quiz App:

An app to help users study for their citizenship test.

## About:

When developing this app, I wrote functional React components, utilizing React hooks to manage local state. I also used Redux to manage a centralized state and manage API queries. This application utilizes Firebase for user authentication, and React Transition Group for the card-flipping animation featured on the test page.

## Starting:

To begin:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Media:

## Next Steps:

I would like to build my own REST API using Postgres and Express to allow users to choose between text-based quizzes and audio-based quizzes. I would also like to allow users to view statistics about their quiz scores over time and about the questions they often answer incorrectly. Using this data, I hope to allow users to take quizzes using questions sourced from this pool of frequently-missed questions.
